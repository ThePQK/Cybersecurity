      <h3> 1. Dumpster Diving </h3>
      <p> It means that attackers look for valuable info in someone's trash, both in the real world and the digital
        world. The purpose of dumpster diving is that sometimes poeple would write down their password or any sensitive
        info so that they will not forget. However, they may dispose it and this is an opportunity for attackers to
        advantage of. Attackers usually look for papers or notepads that have passwords or any sensitive info written
        down, disposed computer hardware, phone numbers etc </p>

      <br>

      <h3> 2. Social Engineering </h3>
      <p> The attacker will pose as an authoritative person and persuade the target in divulging all of his personal
        info. Social engineering is done through communication services such as emails and chat service. In order to
        convince the target in giving his personal info (Passwords, credit numbers), it is acheived through social
        engineering by sending links that appear attractive to open.
        <br>
        <br>
        Such examples are:
        <br>
        <br>
        1. U won $1000 lottery !!!

        <br>
        2. Hi! Do u remember me? I was your classmate a few years ago. I urgently need help. Could u send me $330 pls?
        <br>
        3. This is the ABC company. Your gmail password and credit number info has expired. Pls click this link to
        update them again.
      </p>

      <br>

      <h3> 3. Shoulder Surfing </h3>
      <p> Shoulder surfing means that the attacker (Not digitally) can physcially see the target's personal info
        (Attacker observes the target entering personal info on a device)
        <br>
        <br>
        Such examples are:
        <br>
        <br>
        1. The attacker positions himself such that he can see the target entering credit card info at an atm. The
        attacker will take note of the info on a notepad or a device and use the info for his own benefit
        <br>
        2. The attacker is sitting beside the target at a train and secretly observing the target typing sensitive info
        into his gmail account
        <br>
        3. The attacker is in crowded place, observing anyone that entered any sensitive info on their device since they
        are in close proximity

      <h3> 1. Password Guessing And Automated Password Guessing </h3>
      <p> <span style='color: red;'>Password Guessing </span>: Having the required info about a target after performing
        reconnaissance, the attacker will
        try to guess the password to see if info gathered is sufficient enough to crack the target's password. If not,
        the attacker will proceed to automated password guessing
        <br>
        <br>

        <span style='color: red;'> Automated Password Guessing </span>:
        The attacker creates a looping code that will automatically enter possible passwords from a document every time
        into a system each time when a password picked from the document is wrong. The document may also include
        possible usernames that can be used to enter into the system.
      </p>

      <br>

      <h3> 2. Password Sniffing </h3>
      <p> In our everyday life, a huge amount of traffic passing through networks are constantly carrying packets that
        contain data. This data can be our personal info such as passwords and some of the packets are not encrypted.
        Attackers monitoring the network are able to find out our passwords easily from unencrypted packets using tools
        such as Pass-The-Hash and Wireshark. Nowadays, our passwords are usually encrypted before sending them in a
        packet. Encrypted passwords come in the form of hashes. Some hackers are able to create reverse hash tools. But
        if the passwords were also salted and hashed, the hackers will get a salted passwords even if they were able to
        reverse hash the passwords and this is very difficult for hackers to get hold of our actual password. </p>

      <br>

      <h3> 3. Keystroke Logger </h3>
      <p> <span style='color: red;'> Keystroke logger comes in the form of hardware (USB etc) and software (Applications
          etc). </span> If this is present on the computer, every key pressed on the keyboard is <span
          style='color: red;'> recorded </span>. Once a password has been typed, the attacker will be able to obtain the
        password in clear-text form. No need for any decryption or to guess the password. </p>
