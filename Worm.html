      <h4> Worm (Write Once Read Multiple) </h4>
      <p> A computer worm is a type of malware that infects other systems by spreading to other systems without
        attaching itself to a host program while remaining active on the infected system. It exploits any known
        vulnerablity on the computer and delivers a payload, such as malware, infecting the computer. </p>

    <h1> Examples of Worms </h1>

    <div class="border-bottom">
      <h1 style="color: blue;"> Email Worms </h1>
      <p style="color: red;"> It can spread through email attachments and files. It copies all the emails from the email
        addresses book in a user's contact list and send copies of itself disguised as a genuine application or file.
      </p>

      <p> One such real life case is the <span style="color: purple;"> ILOVEYOU worm </span> . The worm copied all the
        victim's emails in his address book which means his friends, relatives, family etc email addresses. Since
        Microsoft Outlook was widely used to store and send emails, the worm copied the victim's email adresses book
        from Microsft Outlooks and resent itself to the emails it copied in Microsoft Outlook. This allowed the worm to
        spread itself quickly as the receiver of the email would think that it would be safe to open the infected
        attachment sent since it was sent from the victm's email address, someone who they knew. The attachment
        contained a file called 'ILOVEYOU' and it had a vbs (Visual Basic Script) extension which was hidden by default.
        Many people mistook it for a text file and opened it. This allowed the worm to spread even quickier as when
        every one person opened the file, it spread to more people and people who received the email will open it and
        allow the worm to spread again to more people and this cycle repeats itself. Many companies were largely
        affected and had to close down their email server. The damage caused by this worm was around 5-8 billon dollars.

    <div class="border-bottom">
      <h1 style="color: blue;"> File Sharing Worms </h1>
      <p> <span style="color: red;"> It can copy itself on shared folders and spread itself to file-sharing networks.
        </span> Once someone upload the infected file on a public file sharing service, anyone that opens the file will
        allow the worm to infect his computer. Sometimes, it can also be disguised as beign media file.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="border-bottom">
      <h1 style="color: blue;"> Instant Messaging Worms </h1>
      <p> <span style="color: red;"> It can spread to a user's contact list, disguising itself as trustworthy
          application or file. </span> It is sent to a chat service instead of an email. </p>

      <p> An example is the Sohanad worm. It target IM service, Yahoo!. Once the worm infected a user's computer, it
        will send messages to the victim's contact list if it found that the Yahoo messaging service is running. The
        receiver in the contact list will receive a link in the message and he may open the link, only to download a
        copy of the worm. Sohannd worm used social engineering in order to convince the receiver to open the link. </p>
