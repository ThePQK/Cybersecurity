      <h4> Phishing </h4>
      <p> Phishing is a technique in which an attacker pretends to be a trustworthy or legitimate person that tricks the
        victim into giving his personal info via email or other ways of communication </p>

      <p> The attacker pose as legitmate individual or organisation that communicates with the target using emails, SMS
        etc in hopes of obtaining personal info from the target. Before communicating with the target, the attacker
        gather info such as email addresses from the target through social media platforms. </p>

      <p> Through communication with the target, the attacker may provide a malicious link that causes the target to
        download malware upon opening the link or redirect the target to a website that looks like a legitimate website
        but in actual fact, it is a fake website that is trying to trick the target into giving sensitive and personal
        info. </p>

      <h1 style='color: red;'> Example Of Phishing </h1>
      <p> The target may receive an email that originates from a company the target is working for. The email contains a
        message that the target has to update his login credentials to the company's website and a link is provided.
        Unfortunately, the target does not know that this email was created by the attacker and not from the company and
        the target clicks the link. He is then redirected to a fake login page that is an exact replica as his company's
        website login page, which prompts the target to enter his login credentials. Upon entering the credentials, a
        script is used to note down the username and password entered and store it on the attacker's server and
        afterwards it shall redirect the target to the authentic login page and the target will log in once again. The
        target will suspect nothing as he may believe that the page is simply refreshed after 'updating' his login
        credentials in the phished website and has to provide his credentials again in order to log in back into the
        authentic website. The attacker has now been successful in obtaining personal info from his target through the
        phishing. </p>

      <h1 style='color: green;'> How To Prevent Becoming A Victim Of Phishing? </h1>

      <div class='border-bottom'>
        1. Don't open links from unauthorised sources (Emails and SMS)
        <br>
        <br>
        2. Look at the website url. A phished website will have a slight difference in url when compared to the actual
        website
        <br>
        <br>
        3. Don't click on suspucious pop-ups since it can lead to a higher risk of falling victim to phisphing attacks
        <br>
        <br>
        4. Don't enter sensitive info on unsecure or suspucious websites
