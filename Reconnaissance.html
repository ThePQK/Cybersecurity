      <h4> Reconnaissance </h4>
      <p> Before any attack can be done, reconnaissance (Info gathering) has to be carried out to learn more about the
        target or organisation in order for high chances of success </p>

    <div class='border-bottom'>
      <p> Passive reconnaissance refers to the attacker having <span style='color: green;'> no direct interaction
        </span> with the target / organisation or system. This means using open sources to gather info such as social
        media, news channel. The attacker does not communicate with the target or expose himself to the target in any
        way but rather find out more about the target in secret so the target will have no idea that they are being
        targeted.
      </p>

      <br>

      <p> E.g.: The attacker may find more about their target through social media as social media is a platform for a
        huge amount of information that can be retrieved such as email ids, phone number etc. Using this way, the target
        will have no idea that they are being observed.

        <br>

        Attackers may also monitor a network and the packets sent and received by the target. He maybe able to find out
        vital info from unencrypted packets such as passwords without even having to crack the passwords themselves

    <div class='border-bottom'>
      <p> Active reconnaissance refers to the attacker having <span style='color: red;'> direct interaction </span> with
        the target / organisation or system. </p>

      <p> E.g.: The attacker may use social engineering to convince the target to divulge sensitive info such as bank
        account info, passwords etc. </p>

      <p> The attacker may also send his own packets to a server to try get a response that contains info. However, it
        may trigger the intruder detection system of the network which will prevent any attacks from being successful.
