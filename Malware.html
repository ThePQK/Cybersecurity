      <h4> Virus (Vital Resource Under Seige) </h4>
      <p> A virus is a type of malware that exists as a piece of code. It only can self-replicate only after attaching
        itself to a host program or file. After attaching itself to a host program, it will be able to copy itself to
        other applications, files, and removable storage devices </p>

    <h1> COMPONENTS OF A VIRUS </h1>

    <div class='border-bottom'>
      <span style='font-size: 30px; color: green;'> 1. Concealer </span>
      <p> The concealer's job is to make the virus appear as a trustworthy program. A simple way in how the concealer
        work is by changing the app icon of the program as another popular or well known application's icon. This will
        trick the victim into thinking that this program is safe and the chances of the victim opening it is high </p>

      <span style='font-size: 30px; color: blue;'> 2. Payload </span>
      <p> The payload is only a piece of code which decides the behaviour of the virus. Once the program is executed,
        the payload will cause the virus to act in a certain way such as restarting the device infinitely etc </p>

      <span style='font-size: 30px; color: red;'> 3. Replicator </span>
      <p> This allows the virus to propagrate itself to other applications or system and continue to infect more and
        more </p>

    <h1> LIFE CYCLE OF A VIRUS </h1>

    <div class='border-bottom'>
      <span style='font-size: 30px; color: green;'> 1. Dormant </span>
      <p> The virus will be inactive while existing in the system. However, not all viruses will have this stage as they
        may start replicating itself as soon as it is executed </p>

      <span style='font-size: 30px; color: blue;'> 2. Propagation </span>
      <p> After attaching to the system, it will try to copy itself to other group of files or an application so when
        the user migrate these files or application, the virus will be able to travel </p>

      <span style='font-size: 30px; color: purple;'> 3. Trigger </span>
      <p> The trigger decides when the virus is executed. The trigger can be in the form of a date of when the virus
        will be triggered. For e.g.: The date of the trigger of the virus can be 10 November 2000 at 10.00am. When it
        reaches that specific date and time, the virus will be automatically triggered and executed </p>

      <span style='font-size: 30px; color: red;'> 4. Execution </span>
      <p> The virus will be executed after it has been triggered. Before this stage, the virus has tried its best to
        propagate to other applications and systems so to ensure maximum damage to the system or other devices. The user
        will start to feel the 'symptoms' of the virus </p>
